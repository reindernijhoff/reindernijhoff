In my spare time Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [Dittytoy](https://dittytoy.net): Create your generative music online using a Javascript API.
- [OneShader](https://oneshader.net): One fragment shader and your imagination.
- [Turtletoy](https://turtletoy.net): Create your generative art online using a JavaScript Turtle graphics API.
- [Rijkscollection](https://rijkscollection.net): An immersive exploration of art pieces from the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.

If you want, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/reindernijhoff). Donations are highly appreciated and will be used to cover hosting costs and to buy (more) coffee.
